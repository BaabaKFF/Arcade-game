# ARCADE GAME
This is a simple web-based arcade game that helps you exercise your reflexes.
This project was undertaken to practice the use of JavaScript object-oriented programming features as opposed to purely HTML and CSS definitions of visual elements.

### Installation
- Open the arcadeGame.html file in any web browser and start the game by using the keyboard arrow keys. (_Chrome is recommended_)

### How the game works
The aim of the game is to get the player from the grass at the bottom of the game board to the edge of the river at the top without colliding with any enemy bugs. ( _They may look like cute ladybugs, but they are actually timeturners that take you back in time and make you start the game all over again._ ðŸ˜¥ )

- To move the player, use your **up, down, left,** and **right** arrow keys on your keyboard to move **up, down, left,** and **right** respectively.
- Make sure not to get too close to any of the bugs or else it's back to the start.

                                            ENJOY!
